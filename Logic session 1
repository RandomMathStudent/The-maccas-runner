Logic brainstorming session 1 30/8/2025 

Functionality: 
Essentially we have two options in my mind, we build something that interacts with google maps itself, and is like a wrapper that uses the add destionation feature to middle input 
the maccas you need along the way. 
The second option we have is to actually build a frontend as well as a backend, using some sort of frontend language to make a little map maybe like golang or something. 

The first option sounds a lot easier so lets start with that: 

after doing some research, the google maps API is billed and costs a decent amount of money so lets do it a different way. 

HIGH LEVEL WHAT WILL HAPPEN: 
- user puts in an origin input 
- user puts in a destination output 
- we consider possible mcdonalds within some kind of reasonable range (LOGIC STEP HERE) 
- there needs to be some kind of consideration of what maccas are open and have drive through etc, 
we need a ranking of favourable 
- we calculate the two segment journey from origin to mcdonalds then from mcdonalds to destination
