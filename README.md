# The-maccas-runner
Welcome!
This is my Passion Project which I will call "The Maccas Runner" for now. 
It is designed for me to work on something in hopes of expanding my programming knowledge with end goal of maybe easing my way into the software engineering world as well as a chance for me to figure out what I like/dont like about software development!

The idea of the project is to build something using majority google apps functionality, which when inputting a destination will provide the best mcdonalds run for you based on a few different factors and paramaters. 

This is my first time trying a project/coding anything and I have very little programming background so please dont be mean!
